Coding Conventions To be Followed:


Spaces on both side of binary operators:
ex->     $a = $b + $c;


Spaces inside parenthesis but not if parenthesis are empty:
ex->     $a = putFoo( $b );
		 $a = getFoo();


Spaces while declaring an array but not while accessing elements or declaring empty array:
ex->     $array = [ 'first', 'second' ];
		 $array = [];
		 $element = $array[0];


Control statements should be followed by spaces:
ex->     if ( isFoo() ) {
		 	 $a = 'foo';	
		 }

Comments should be followed by a space:
ex->     // This is a comment.


While typecasting don't use spaces:
ex->    (int)$foo;


Use ternary operator for short conditions:
ex->    $firstName = isset( $_SESSION[ 'firstName' ] ) ? $_SESSION[ 'firstName' ] : '';
